# VideoChatDemo

Demonstrates a video chat app using OpenTok's framework and Parse cloud code. 

You will need to include the OpenTok.framework to the project for it to work. Visit https://tokbox.com/ for that.

Parse cloud code should be deployed to your Parse app. You will find it in the CloudCode folder.

Use CocoaPods.
